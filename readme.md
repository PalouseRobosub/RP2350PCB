## Rp2350 PCB
PCB for using the Rp2350 over CAN, exposing GPIO and ADC pins, designed in KiCAD v9

Current revision is a prototype for verifying we can actually hand assemble all the parts, hence the use of a linear regulator and dense size for optimizing cost.
Next revision will likely be bigger and use a switching regulator.
